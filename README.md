# SA-Legal-With-Clasp-Draft-File

This file was created because of the limitations of google apps script and the need to have a seperate file with dummy data, dummy email, and a dummy calendar in order to test out the functions and interactions prior to committing to the production file. This minimizes issues with the production file and allows me to pre-address issues
